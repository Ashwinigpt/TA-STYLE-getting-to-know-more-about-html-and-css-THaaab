<!-- 
### Create a website having 3 separate pages.

#### TODO ðŸ’»:

1. Create a multi-page website, having at least three pages connected.

2. Each page must have one header and footer.

3. In between the header and footer, there must be the main content of the page.

4. The main content must have at least two articles.

5. Each article must have one image.

6. Use different background colors for different pages.

7. Using CSS resets is necessary.

- use appropriate semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation clean. -->

            <h2>Flowers</h2>
            <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).
                 The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.
                 Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.</p>
            <p>The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.
                 Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.
                 Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.
                 This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.[1]</p>

            <h2>Types of flowers:</h2>
            <p>"Collectively the calyx and corolla form the perianth (see diagram).

            Calyx: the outermost whorl consisting of units called sepals; these are typically green and enclose the rest of the flower in the bud stage, however, they can be absent or prominent and petal-like in some species.
            Corolla: the next whorl toward the apex, composed of units called petals, which are typically thin, soft and colored to attract animals that help the process of pollination.
            Perigone: in monocots the calyx and corolla are indistinguishable thus the whorls of the perianth or perigone are called tepals."</p>
